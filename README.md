# MiniDB

MiniDB is a tiny educational relational database implemented in Python.

Goals:

- Simple in-memory tables with schemas
- Tiny SQL subset:
  - `CREATE TABLE`
  - `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)`
  - `SELECT ... FROM ...`
- Clean architecture you can extend with:
  - WHERE clauses
  - indexes
  - persistence
  - transactions

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```
